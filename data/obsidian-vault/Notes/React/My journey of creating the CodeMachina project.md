## Intro

This is not intended to be a guide, it is just a log of all the things I had to do to create CodeMachina site using NextJS, Tailwind, DaisyUI, StoryBook and Vercel.

Here are some of the things I did to create this side project:
- [[Creating a NextJS Project using TurboRepo]]
- [[Adding TailwindCSS and DaisyUI to a NextJS Project]]
- [[Adding StoryBook to a component library in  TurboRepo with support for TailwindCSS and DaisyUI]]
