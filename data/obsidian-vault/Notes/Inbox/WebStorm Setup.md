# Plugins

- Gradianto Theme [Gradianto - IntelliJ IDEs Theme | Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12334-gradianto)

This theme is not as heavy or complete as the Material theme but it provides a set of nice themes to use

- Atom Material Icons [Gradianto - IntelliJ IDEs Theme | Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12334-gradianto)

This icons just make the IDE look way better!

- Save Actions [Save Actions - IntelliJ IDEs Plugin | Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions)

I use this to organize imports on save and can also be used to do more powerful things.

# Setup
