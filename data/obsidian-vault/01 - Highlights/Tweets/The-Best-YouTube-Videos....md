## Highlights
- The best YouTube videos have a clear structure.
  There are 4 simple steps we can use to hook the viewer and keep them engaged throughout our videos.
  This is the HIVE Framework 👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799619801350144))
- The HIVE Framework consists of 4 key parts:
  1. Hook
  2. Intro
  3. Value
  4. End Screen

- 1. The Hook
  The first 10 seconds of your video are critical.
  With our attention spans only getting shorter, you’ve got to keep people engaged by creating a hook that shows them what they’re about to watch. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799632803610627))
- The best hooks address an issue or make an emotional connection with the audience:
  -Use enticing b-roll
  -Ask a question
  -Show a transformation
  -Share a thought-provoking fact
  -Provide a quick tip ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799635832000513))
- 2. The Intro
  There are broadly three types of videos:
  -Discoverable - hook new viewers into watching more of your videos
  -Community - deepen the relationship with existing viewers
  -Sales - get the viewer to take an action ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799637803311105))
- Technically, you only really need an intro for the 'Discoverable' type videos - where your viewership is outside of your core audience.
  You can follow these intro structures:
  👉 “I am X and I do Y.”
  👉 “I help X do Y.”
  👉 “I help X do Y by Z.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799639804006400))
- 3. Provide Value 
  This is the main chunk of your video. 
  How can we add value to our audiences while keeping them engaged?
  There are two main things to think about: the structure, and your writing style. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799641791987715))
- There are broadly 4 types of video structure: 
  📝 Listicle Structure 
  3️⃣ Triplet Structure 
  🎵 Quartet Structure
  📚 Story Structure ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799645206167553))
- 📝 Listicle
  The more you speak from personal experience, the lower lift creating consistent videos will be. 
  Listicles are great because you can literally riff off 5-10 things and provide clear value to your audience while doing so. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799646955294720))
- 3️⃣ Triplet
  This is really helpful for topics where you have three broader statements, but you want to give the audience action points within those.
  Within each of your 3 main points, you’ve got a number of smaller points.
  This is a good example: https://t.co/m1sqYQ2CRa ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799649266339842))
- 🎵 Quartet
  Why, What, How and What If?
  This structure works incredibly well for educational videos or topics where you want to convince the user that said topic is going to be a positive change.
  It also works great for sales videos when you want the audience to follow a CTA. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799651430600709))
- 📚 Story 
  A more creative way of getting your point across. 
  The Hero’s Journey is commonly used by fiction authors, but when you simplify it’s actually quite similar to the Quartet approach with a bit more flair. 
  Think more B-Roll, story-telling and personal experiences.

- 4. The End Screen 
  If the viewer has got to the end of your video, they’re probably your ideal audience. Now your main aim is to keep them on your channel.
  The best ending to a video is when your audience doesn't even realise it's the end. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799662495178753))
- At the end of your video, create a segue to point the audience towards another similar or helpful video of yours, using an "if" or story to lead into it.
  Even if you haven’t made the next video yet, start to create links between your content. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799664474791938))
- Bonus tip: Make use of YouTube's end cards to give viewers a visual cue right on screen. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1541799666404278273))
- That’s the HIVE framework of how to structure your YouTube videos.
  I teach this framework and many others in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.
