## Highlights
- The capacity to transport lactate through high-intensity exercise is trainable
- Ideal training protocol: 4 days of zone 2 training lasting 60-90 minutes + 1 day of anaerobic/high-intensity effortHigh-intensity suggestion: keep it simple – 4 minutes high effort, near heart rate max + 4 minutes of recovery x 4-5 cyclesPSA: to be considered a zone 2 workout, you need to spend the entire duration in zone 2 for the benefit – not just an average of zone 2 oscillating faster and slower periods
