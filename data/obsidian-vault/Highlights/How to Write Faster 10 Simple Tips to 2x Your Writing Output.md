## Highlights
- 1. Separate research from writing
- 2. Write now, edit later
- 3. Write an outline
- 4. Stuck? Write your conclusion sooner
- 5. Write your introduction last
- 6. Forget about being perfect
- 7. Practice like an Olympian
- If you write every day, it’ll feel natural to knock out a thousand words before your Corn Flakes. If you write a blog post once a month, it’s going to take several hours to warm up and produce something worthy for your readers. If you’re starting off as a blogger and you find your progress is slow, accept it for what it is. If you keep putting the work in, you will become faster and better
- 8. Set a timer
- Set an alarm for thirty minutes. Work on your post without stopping or doing anything else until the buzzer sounds. You can use these half hour windows of time for one task related to your post e.g. writing, editing, laying it out in WordPress. If it helps, you can challenge yourself to reach a certain word count before the buzzer sounds.
- 9. Stop writing
- Get up from the desk. Go for a sleep, a walk, make dinner, eat, drink, do anything but think about HTML, call-to-actions and social proof. Don’t risk burn out
- 10. Organise your research and notes
