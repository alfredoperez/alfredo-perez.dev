## Highlights
- Developer Experience is about creating an environment in which a developer can do their best work. DX is the context in which developer productivity can be unleashed, in which individual needs can be successfully balanced with those of the engineering team. DX is about developer feelings – it is a sociotechnical system which should consider every touchpoint a developer interacts with to plan and produce software, from learning a platform to the very first line of code all the way through its promotion into production. From documentation to SDKs to version control to monitoring and observability, everything a developer touches will have an impact on their productivity. Culture too, helps to define a good DX of the lack of it.
- DX allows developers to be more effective, by making the good thing the easy thing – in areas such as testing, security and observability this is increasingly important.
- DX removes points of friction in setting up environments. DX is coding without yak-shaving. Good DX is an iPhone moment
- In 2022 it’s obvious that this approach cannot stand. FAANG and startup companies are increasingly building DX teams to work with platform teams to improve overall organisational productivity and development velocity.
- DX is becoming increasingly critical for companies of all shapes and sizes because developers are the most important constituency in building digital products and services. Competition for talent is fierce, and developers are more demanding than ever. Why would a developer put up with a poor developer experience when they can likely find a job that better aligns with their needs and preferences?
- User experience is a concept that captures how persons feel about products, systems and services. It evolved from disciplines such as interaction design and usability to a much richer scope that includes feelings, motivations, and satisfaction. Similarly, developer experience could be defined as a means for capturing how developers think and feel about their activities within their working environments, with the assumption that an improvement of the developer experience has positive impacts on characteristics such as sustained team and project performance.
- Developer Experience Engineering is a hybrid role that is an intersection between more traditional advocacy of engaging in communities, writing posts, and doing open source work with engineering work
- Developer Experience is the equivalent of User Experience when the primary user of the product is a developer. DX cares about the developer experience of using a product, its libs, SDKs, documentation, frameworks, open-source solutions, general tools, APIs, etc. 
  DX and UX share some principles, but with differences in good practice, this is because developers have different needs in their daily context compared to an average user. 
  In short, DX is important for the same reasons that UX is important. Developers who find good DX are happier, promote more, and use their product longer.
